<p>My theme is a short little story I make up from week one its about a wizard fighting three ice witch there, in my story I change the story around a little. There are conditional, some arrays, while loops, nested conditional, and a function. I kept this theme because I wanted to see if I could keep expanding my story to fit the criteria of the assignment every week.</p>
